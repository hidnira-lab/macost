## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: Static export for Tauri — `output: export` + `images.unoptimized: true` must be added to next.config.ts on Day 1; Tauri APK shows blank screen without it
- [Pre-phase]: PyJWT (not python-jose) for FastAPI JWT verification — python-jose is abandoned and broken on Python 3.10+
- [Pre-phase]: tauri-plugin-store for Supabase session persistence — localStorage is unreliable in Tauri Android WebView
- [Pre-phase]: AI/vision provider not yet selected — must decide at Phase 3 start; blocks SCAN-01 and AIINS-01

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Android NDK/toolchain setup must be verified on Hidayat's machine on Day 1 before other Phase 1 work proceeds
- UptimeRobot keep-alive for Render backend must be active before Phase 2 integration testing (cold start = 30-60s)
- AI/vision provider selection (GPT-4o Vision vs Google Cloud Vision) must be resolved at Phase 3 start
